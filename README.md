# FFlag editor
![GitHub Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/BLOCKCE/FFlag-editor/total.svg)

Recently you may have noticed your fastflags not working! This is because Roblox add a fastflag whitelist instead of a blacklist.
But this can easily be bypassed with this fastflag editor. It works by editing a different clientsettings file and it also supports any Roblox bootstrapper (Bloxstrap, Fishstrap, Voidstrap, and so on).
This will probably be patched very soon so use it while you can!

## Installation
1. Install the exe file
2. Run it

or

1. Install the python file
2. Run The script
```bash
python fflag.py
```
